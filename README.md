# Product Cards
This web site is a simple display of product cards in the form of T-shirts for sale on a *Big Lebowski* themed online store. 

It was built as an exercise to learn how to use CSS and HTML styling elements.

## Features
* The site is responsive to the size of the user's screen
* A "sold out" graphic is overlaid on one of the T-shirt cards to indicate its unavailability.
